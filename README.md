# snooker-scoerboard

## Description

A snooker scorecard that displays each player's score and the remaining available points on the table. This allows you to visually determine whether the trialing player has enough points remaining to win at any given time.

The application is still in development, but it functions as a proof of concept with no major obvious bugs.
